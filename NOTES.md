Introduction
------------

I'm Matthew from Brandwatch.
Brandwatch ...

This will cover the way that ideas become reality.

 * How to choose what to build
 * How to build it
 * How to release it

Will use a project from Brandwatch to demonstrate each of the steps.

Features
--------

How do you know what to build, or what to change?

Every time you decide to build something, you have constraints.
The constraints can be things like money, time or expertise.

Even startups have constraints.
They can't build something if they don't know how.
They have to be able to sell what they create.

The best thing to build is the one that makes the most money for the least cost.
You need to find what is cheap for you and valuable to others.

What do customers want?
What improvements can be made?
What ways can you make more out of what you already have?

What is the vision for the product?
What parts still need to be done?

Can get lots of ideas quickly.
Too many.
How to choose what to do next?
